	    <br>
	    <p><span class="dark-grey">[26]</span> <strong>Figure 1</strong> is a block diagram of an operating
environment 100 of a digital assistant according to some embodiments. The terms "digital assistant," "virtual assistant," "intelligent automated assistant," or "automatic digital assistant," refer to any information processing system that interprets natural language input in spoken and/or textual form to deduce user intent (e.g., identify a task type that corresponds to the natural language input), and performs actions based on the deduced user intent (e.g., perform a task corresponding to the identified task type). For example, to act on a deduced user intent, the system can perform one or more of the following: identifying a task flow with steps and parameters designed to accomplish the deduced user intent (e.g., identifying a task type), inputting specific requirements from the deduced user intent into the task flow, executing the task flow by invoking programs, methods, services, APIs, or the like (e.g., sending a request to a service provider); and generating output responses to the user in an audible (e.g., speech) and/or visual form.</p>
