	    <p><span class="mid-grey">[51]</span> The I/O interface 306 couples input/output devices 316 of the digital assistant system 300, such as displays, a keyboard, touch screens, and microphones, to the user interface module 322. The I/O interface 306, in conjunction with the user interface module 322, receives user inputs (e.g., voice input, keyboard inputs, touch inputs, etc.) and process them accordingly. In some embodiments, when the digital assistant is implemen- ted on a standalone user device, the digital assistant system 300 includes any of the components and I/O and communication interfaces described with respect to the user device 104 in Figure 2 (e.g., one or more microphones 228). In some embodiments, the digital assistant system 300 represents the server portion of a digital assistant implementation, and interacts with the user through a client-side portion residing on a user device (e.g., the user device 104 shown in Figure 2).</p>
		<p><span class="mid-grey">[52]</span> In some embodiments, the network communications interface 308 includes wired communication port(s) 312 and/or <mark>wireless transmission and reception circuitry 314</mark>. The wired communication port(s) receive and send communication signals via one or more wired interfaces, e.g., Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc. The wireless circuitry 314 typically receives and sends RF signals and/or optical signals from/to communicati- ons networks and other communications devices. The wireless communica- tions may use any of a plurality of communications standards, protocols and technologies, such as GSM, EDGE, CDMA, TDMA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, VoIP, Wi- MAX, or any other suitable communication protocol. The network commu- nications interface 308 enables communication between the digital assistant system 300 with networks, such as the Internet, an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other devices.</p>
